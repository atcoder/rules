AtCoder Rules against Generative AI - Version 20251003
----

# Introduction

These rules apply only during ongoing AtCoder Beginner Contest (hereafter referred to as ABC), AtCoder Regular Contest (hereafter referred to as ARC), regardless of division and AtCoder Grand Contest (hereafter referred to as AGC).

These rules do not apply to AtCoder Heuristic Contest; instead, [the rules here](https://info.atcoder.jp/entry/ahc-llm-rules-en) apply. They do not apply when practicing with past problems. During ABC, ARC and AGC contests, these rules apply to Unrated participants as well. The rules announced here have been established in accordance with the capabilities and usage status of generative AI as of October 2025. We plan to modify the rules according to future changes in AI circumstances.

Please check the following for the background of these rules:

## Rules

- The use of generative AI is generally prohibited during ongoing ABC, ARC and AGC. Exceptions are limited to the following use.
  - Problem statement translation:
    - When using interactive generative AI for translation, only the following is permitted: Write the text below at the beginning, followed by either copied text of the problem statement or a screenshot of the problem statement.
      - <i>The following text or image is a problem statement from an AtCoder contest. During an ongoing AtCoder contest, only the translation of the problem statement is allowed. Any other outputs such as summaries of the problem statement, algorithms, or strategies are strictly prohibited. Please provide only the translation of the problem statement into [language].</i>
      - Replace [language] with the name of the target natural language.
    - For AI tools that only provide translation functionality, you may input the problem statement directly.

### What is Generative AI

- In these rules, "generative AI" is defined as "artificial intelligence that can generate new data such as text or code based on training data."
- Examples primarily include large language models such as GPT, Gemini, Gemma, Llama, Claude, etc.

### Examples

- The use of generative AI that substitutes your own reasoning in problem understanding, logic creation, or decision-making is prohibited:
  - You must not use generative AI to summarize problem statements.
  - You must not input problem statements, their summaries, excerpts, or sub-problems into generative AI (including code completion tools) to output code or natural language explanations of solutions.
  - You must not use generative AI for diagnosing compilation errors or bugs.
- AI-based code completion (e.g., Copilot) is prohibited.
  - Turn off completion features during the contest.
  - Nonâ€“AI-based completion features are permitted.
- Programming-language conversion using generative AI (e.g., converting code written in Python to C++) is prohibited.
- If you are not using generative AI, these rules do not apply. For example, the following tools are permitted:
  - Non-AI-based tools that analyze problem statements and write sample input/output data to files
  - Non-AI-based tools that analyze problem statements and generate input/output handling code
- Using code or other materials that were created using generative AI before the contest begins is permitted.
- The following tools are explicitly permitted:
  - WolframAlpha, Mathematica
  - OEIS (The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences)
- Internet Search
  - Search results may display AI-generated overviews (e.g., Google Search "AI Overview"). Please take care not to view such content.
  - Do not use conversational AI search modes (e.g., Google Search "AI Mode").
